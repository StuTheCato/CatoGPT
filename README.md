# CatoGPT - Discord Bot Documentation

## Overview
CatoGPT is an AI Discord bot designed to interact with users through natural language processing. It leverages the llama API to provide responses to user queries.

## Functionality
CatoGPT responds to user queries posted in the designated Discord channel. It utilizes the llama API to generate responses to questions. The bot listens for commands prefixed with '!', specifically the `!ask` command followed by a question. Once a question is received, the bot processes it through the llama API and posts the generated response in the specified Discord channel.

## Setup Instructions
To set up CatoGPT for your Discord server, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain Discord Bot Token**: Obtain a Discord bot token by creating a bot application on the Discord Developer Portal. Replace the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` variable in the provided script with your actual Discord bot token.

2. **Obtain llama API Token**: Obtain an API token from the llama API service. Replace the `LLAMA_API_TOKEN` variable in the provided script with your actual llama API token.

3. **Specify Target Channel ID**: Replace the `TARGET_CHANNEL_ID` variable in the script with the ID of the Discord channel where you want CatoGPT to respond.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip: `pip install discord.py llamaapi`

5. **Run the Bot**: Execute the provided script containing the CatoGPT bot code.

## Usage
Once the bot is running and added to your Discord server, users can interact with it using the `!ask` command followed by a question. For example: `!ask What is the capital of France?`
CatoGPT will process the question and respond in the specified Discord channel with the generated answer.

## Important Note
Ensure that you keep your Discord bot token and llama API token confidential. Do not share these tokens publicly or include them in your code repositories. Consider using environment variables or secure storage methods to manage your tokens securely.

## Disclaimer
CatoGPT is an AI-based bot and may not always provide accurate or reliable responses. Responses generated by CatoGPT are based on the data and models available at the time of interaction and may vary in quality and relevance. Use the bot for entertainment and informational purposes only, and do not rely on its responses for critical decisions or actions.

## Conclusion
CatoGPT offers an interactive and engaging experience for Discord users, allowing them to ask questions and receive responses generated by AI. By leveraging the llama API, the bot provides access to a vast knowledge base and natural language understanding capabilities.
